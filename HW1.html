<h1>Mobile Web Application Using HTML and JavaScript.</h1>
<div class = "clearfix"> <img src="Drawing.jpeg" alt = "This is me" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
My name is Eric, and this is my third year at IVC. I'm studying engineering at the moment but coding seemed like a practical skill every technology related industry worker should have. I hope to transfer soon and move on with life.

<p>
I'm taking this class because I want to learn how to make websites and have the skill in hand when I need it later on in my life.
